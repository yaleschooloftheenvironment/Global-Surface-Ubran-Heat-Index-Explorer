# Global-Surface-Ubran-Heat-Index-Explorer
The Global Surface UHI Explorer is an interactive web app to monitor urban heat island (UHI) intensities of practically all urban clusters on Earth. The app is built on the Google Earth Engine platform and allows users to query the UHI data of urban areas using a simple interface. The UHI dataset was created based on the simplified urban-extent (SUE) algorithm detailed in Chakraborty and Lee, 2019.
